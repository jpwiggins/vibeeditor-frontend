# Netlify Deployment Guide

## Your project is now ready for Netlify deployment! ðŸš€

### What was fixed:
1. âœ… Added `netlify.toml` configuration file
2. âœ… Updated JavaScript to work without backend API
3. âœ… Fixed Vite build configuration for multiple HTML files
4. âœ… Added proper redirects and headers
5. âœ… Removed backend dependencies from payment flow
6. âœ… Fixed module script type warning

### Deployment Steps:

1. **Push to Git Repository**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Ready for Netlify deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Deploy on Netlify**
   - Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
   - Click "Add new site" â†’ "Import an existing project"
   - Connect your Git repository
   - Netlify will automatically detect the settings from `netlify.toml`
   - Click "Deploy site"

### Build Settings (Auto-detected from netlify.toml):
- **Build command**: `npm run build`
- **Publish directory**: `build`
- **Node version**: 18

### Post-Deployment:
1. Your landing page will be available at: `https://your-site.netlify.app/`
2. Your React app will be at: `https://your-site.netlify.app/app/`

### Payment Integration Notes:
- Currently configured for frontend-only deployment
- Payment buttons show contact information instead of direct Stripe checkout
- To enable live payments, you'll need to add Netlify Functions or backend API

### Next Steps for Full Payment Integration:
1. Set up Netlify Functions for Stripe webhook handling
2. Or deploy a separate backend API
3. Update the payment flow to connect with your backend

### Files Changed:
- `netlify.toml` (new)
- `landing-page.html` (updated payment handling)
- `vite.config.mjs` (updated build config)
- `public/_redirects` (new)
- `public/api-placeholder.html` (new)
- `index.html` (fixed script type)

Your site is now production-ready for static deployment! ðŸŽ‰
